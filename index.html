      <p class="ml-3">Mesa County Partners was designed to connect new mentors with at-risk youth in order to provide them 
        with a positive role model. We have observed that Mesa County Partners does not clearly display resources 
        available for mentors on their website which causes new users to feel that 
        they may not be supported through the process. </p>

      <h5 class="ml-3 display-8 font-weight-bold">Solution</h5>
      <p class="ml-3">Redesign the homepage, navigation structure and key internal pages to clearly highlight

        Partners offers their mentors. </p>

        Some insights into our interviews were that many felt unprepared to deal with intense issues that their mentee might have. We also observed that many were concerned with the time commitment needed to properly support the youth they’d be paired with.
        
        With these concerns expressed, almost all of our users interviewed said they had positive experiences, whether being mentored during their own childhood or making a difference in a youth’s life when they became an adult.</p>
  
        <p class=" ml-5 h3  genParagraph topMarg">
          A valuable insight that we gained, across all users was how much support they would receive before and during a mentorship. Users mentioned orientation, education, and other supportive means to help them not fail at the mentorship they’ve committed to.

        <li>Further Testing will need to be conducted to validate the new “Join us” button that I created. From the fly in micro animation, to how many times it appears through the user journey, and how now the Sign up will automatically reveal itself when you land on the mentorship page. Based off testing feedback, I would iterate further on the design. 
          These new components could then be integrated into the Mobile app and Tablet version.
          </li>
          <li>Rich content needs to be developed once the user does the initial sign up. The response via email and possibly follow up phone call will need to be just as positive, comforting and reassuring as the user progresses through the steps to becoming a mentor. This support also needs to continue as they are paired with a youth to ensure the success of both Senior and Junior Partner.
          </li>
          <li>Continue with building out the Mobile and Tablet Designs - User flow, navigation, pages and testing)
          </li>
          <li>Set up a content meeting in terms of lifestyle imagery, whether reviewing existing assets or plan multiple photoshoots to capture high res photography for the site.
          </li>
          <li>Set up a stakeholder meeting with Mesa County Partners to present our Case Study and receive feedback. If well received, this Case Study could be used when a planned Redesign will occur. 
          </li>
          <li>Further iterating on content (Mentorship support and process of becoming a mentor) based on more user testing and feedback from stakeholders.
